# Haskell-Codes
A set of codes that show how the basic Haskell constructs are implemented. Programs include the questions given as homeworks in the Introduction to Computer Science
course as well as my own examples to help understand learners of the language some basic concepts like recursion, set notation, and higher-order functions.
